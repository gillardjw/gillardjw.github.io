        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            My research interests are inspired by problems of statistics or data science, and I use ideas from linear algebra and optimisation theory to solve them.
            At the moment I am particularly interested in the structured low-rank approximation problem, which is the problem of finding a low-rank approximation of a matrix with structure.
            This has led to new methods and approaches for time-series analysis, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also worked in mathematics higher education pedagogy, and have worked on diagnostic testing, mathematics support services, the National Student Survey and Teaching Excellence Framework.
