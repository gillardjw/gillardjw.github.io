        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Professor of Statistics at the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/mathematics"> School of Mathematics</a>, Cardiff University. 
        I hold the position of Deputy Head in the School of Mathematics and oversee the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/statistics"> Statistics Research Group</a>.
        I serve as Cardiff's <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Turing</a> University Network Lead and act as the Academic Lead for <a href="https://welshcrucible.org.uk/"> Welsh Crucible</a>.
        My CV is available <a href="cv_jwg.pdf">here</a>.        </p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
                <ul>
            <li>Along with Konstantin Usevich, CNRS, I am preparing a Springer monograph "Low-rank matrix approximations and statistical applications", due to appear in 2025.</li>
            <li>With Phillipe Dreesen (Maastricht University), Ivan Markovsky (CIMNE, Barcelona) and Konstantin Usevich (CNRS), 
                we have completed work on a new method to extend the conditions to enable exact recovery in structured matrix completion. This has been submitted. Further work is in progress. </li>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            My research interests are inspired by problems of statistics or data science, and I use ideas from linear algebra and optimisation theory to solve them.
            At the moment I am particularly interested in the structured low-rank approximation problem, which is the problem of finding a low-rank approximation of a matrix with structure.
            This has led to new methods and approaches for time-series analysis, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also worked in mathematics higher education pedagogy, having worked on diagnostic testing, mathematics support services, the National Student Survey and Teaching Excellence Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have collaborated extensively with industry, in particular the Office for National Statistics and the NHS, with a number of publications based on our joint work.

        <h2>Current Teaching at Cardiff</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MA1501/MA1551 Statistical Inference. I have taught this module at Cardiff for several years. I have written a Springer textbook, 
                <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-39561-2">A First Course in Statistical Inference</a>, on the material I cover.</li>
            <li>MAT007 Statistics and Operational Research in Goverment. This is predominately taught by staff from the Office for National Statistics, Welsh Government and Digital Health and Care Wales,
                and provides insight into the data-driven work within these organisations. </li>     
        </ul>
